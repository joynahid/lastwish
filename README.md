# What is Last Wish?
Okay. This was just a random project of mine that I did getting bored and turned out a nice little trainer program that will suggest you problems according to your past problem solving type from codeforces. I know there are a lot of tools but I believe it's a different type of practice approach. You might give it a shot.

## How it works?
- Step 1: Generates the median rating of your solved problems.
- Step 2: Considers the difficulty given by you. Default is 40. It works most of the time.
- Step 3: Suggests you 20 problems sorted by number of people solved it.
  
If you can ensure your high median rating of your solved problems, I believe you can get better and always solve good problems.

## How to install?
If you want it to run in your local machine, you might consider follow the documentation of [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

But the simplest way to do it for now is,

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
